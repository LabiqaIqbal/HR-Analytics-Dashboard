# HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project leverages Power BI to analyze HR data, focusing on employee attrition, satisfaction, and performance across different departments and job roles. The interactive dashboard helps HR professionals and managers identify trends, key drivers, and insights to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

### Objectives:
1. **Employee Attrition Analysis**: Analyze and visualize employee attrition trends by department, overtime status, and job role.
2. **Performance and Satisfaction Trends**: Examine the impact of training opportunities on performance ratings and overall satisfaction.
3. **Tenure and Growth Insights**: Explore the relationship between employee tenure, training opportunities, and satisfaction.

### Key Features:
- **KPI Cards**: Display key metrics such as Employee Attrition Rate and Average Tenure.
- **Gauge Charts**: For measuring performance and satisfaction levels.
- **Bar Chart**: Attrition by department, segmented by overtime.
- **Clustered Column Chart**: Self-rating vs manager rating across job roles.
- **Slicers**: Age Groups, Salary Level, and Training Opportunity filters.
- **Insights Section**: Key takeaways and analysis for easy decision-making.

### Tools Used:
- Power BI (Dashboard Creation, DAX for Calculations)
- Excel (Dataset preprocessing)

### Dataset:
The dataset includes information on employees, such as demographics, job roles, satisfaction scores, training opportunities, and performance ratings. Two key tables were used:
1. **Employee Data**: Demographics, job details, tenure, attrition status.
2. **Performance Data**: Satisfaction scores, performance ratings, and training details.

### Key Insights:
- **Attrition Analysis**: Sales and HR departments have the highest attrition rates.
- **Satisfaction Trends**: Training opportunities significantly boost satisfaction.
- **Performance Gaps**: Self-ratings differ from manager ratings, highlighting areas for improvement.
- **Attrition & Overtime**: Employees working overtime tend to have higher attrition rates.

### Future Scope:
- Expand the analysis to include more departments or regions.
- Perform a deeper correlation analysis between training opportunities and job satisfaction.

## How to Use:
- Open `HR_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboard.
- Use slicers to filter by age, salary, department, and training opportunities.
